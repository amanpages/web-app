# web-app
This is a react based web application
# There is a counter which gets to increase and decrease and with increase the color of the page changes and upon reset it gets to zero and it maintains the state of page i.e after refresh also the color remains same.

# Next we have a userform data where the form data is submitted to the form and the data stays in page and when we change the data and try to exit browser it alert for the unsaved changes and asks before exit. The data is stored in local storage and from there given to text editor.

# The data of the user form submitted is displayed on the Rich Text editor which shows the user data which we just submitted and there is also option to clear data.
